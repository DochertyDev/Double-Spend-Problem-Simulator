# Double Spend Problem Simulator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity First
The project prioritizes simplicity in design and implementation. Features should be easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Avoid overengineering and focus on delivering a functional static web app.

### II. Static Web App Foundation
The simulator is built as a static web app. It must be lightweight, fast, and accessible. All functionality should be client-side, with no reliance on server-side processing.

### III. Educational Focus
The simulator is designed to educate users about the double spend problem. All features must enhance understanding through clear visuals, interactive elements, and explanatory content.

### IV. Accessibility and Usability
The app must be accessible to a wide audience. Follow web accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) and ensure the interface is intuitive and user-friendly.

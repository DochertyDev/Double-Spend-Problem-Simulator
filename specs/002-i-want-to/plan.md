# Implementation Plan: Web App for Double Spend Problem Simulation

**Branch**: `002-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `C:\Users\Sean\Projects\Double-Spend-Problem-Simulator\specs\002-i-want-to\spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
A user, likely a student or individual interested in economics, visits the web application to understand the "double-spend" problem in the context of fractional-reserve banking. They can input initial financial values, run a simulation, and observe how money is created through different visualizations like tables and graphs. The user can also enable an educational mode to get more context on financial terms. The application will be a self-contained static web app using HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, D3.js, and Chart.js.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
**Primary Dependencies**: D3.js, Chart.js
**Storage**: N/A (client-side)
**Testing**: Jest, Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web Browser (Static Web App)
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: Fast, lightweight, responsive UI with client-side rendering.
**Constraints**: Must be a static web app with no server-side processing. All calculations and visualizations are handled on the client-side.
**Scale/Scope**: A self-contained educational tool demonstrating the double-spend problem.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Simplicity First**: The design must be simple and avoid over-engineering.
- **Static Web App Foundation**: The app must be a static web app with no server-side processing.
- **Educational Focus**: All features must enhance understanding of the double-spend problem.
- **Accessibility and Usability**: The app must follow web accessibility standards (WCAG).

```

**Structure Decision**: The project is a single-page static web application. The structure is based on the "Single project" option, with directories for components, services (for simulation logic), and styles. `index.html` will be the main entry point.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved. The research will focus on best practices for using D3.js and Chart.js for data visualization, and Jest and Testing Library for testing.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/*`, failing tests, `quickstart.md`, agent-specific file. Since this is a client-side application, API contracts are not applicable. Instead, this phase will define the data structures and their interactions.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

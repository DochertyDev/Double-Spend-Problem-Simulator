# Feature Specification: Web App for Double Spend Problem Simulation

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a modern and sleek web app to demonstrate the double spend problem and need specifications created. Before creating any specification details, review the details from the constitution.md file and the README.md file for context. Base the specifications on the context files provided."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user, likely a student or individual interested in economics, visits the web application to understand the "double-spend" problem in the context of fractional-reserve banking. They can input initial financial values, run a simulation, and observe how money is created through different visualizations like tables and graphs. The user can also enable an educational mode to get more context on financial terms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user lands on the simulator page, **When** they input an initial deposit of $1,000, set a reserve ratio of 10%, and click "Run Simulation", **Then** the system visually demonstrates the cycle of deposits, loans, and redeposits, and a dashboard updates to show the total money created.
2. **Given** a simulation is in progress, **When** the user switches from the "Table View" to the "Graph View", **Then** the display updates to show a chart plotting the growth of the money supply across simulation cycles without interrupting or resetting the simulation.
3. **Given** "Education Mode" is active, **When** the user hovers their mouse over the term "Reserves" in the UI, **Then** a tooltip appears with a simple definition, such as "The portion of deposits that a bank must hold in cash and not lend out."

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters a reserve ratio of 100%? (Expected: No new money is created).
- How does the system handle non-numeric or negative values entered into the input fields?
- What is the system's behavior if the simulation is set to run for an exceptionally large number of cycles (e.g., >1,000,000)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow a user to input a custom initial deposit amount.
- **FR--002**: The system MUST allow a user to define the number of simulation cycles or let it run until the available loanable amount is negligible.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow a user to adjust the fractional-reserve percentage.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide at least two distinct visualization modes: a **Table View** detailing the numbers at each cycle, and a **Graph View** plotting the growth of the money supply.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST display a dashboard with key metrics: starting deposit, total money created, and the current reserve-to-deposit ratio.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST feature an "Education Mode" that provides contextual explanations (e.g., via tooltips) for key financial terms.
- **FR-007**: The user MUST be able to play, pause, and step through the simulation cycles.
- **FR-008**: The application MUST be a self-contained static web app, with all calculations and visualizations handled on the client-side.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide a side-by-side comparison mode to simulate two different scenarios (e.g., 10% vs. 20% reserve ratio) simultaneously in split view.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST include a 3D flow diagram visualization that shows how deposits, reserves, and successive loans move through the banking system to produce potential double-spend effects in a fractional-reserve context.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Simulation Cycle**: Represents a single step in the simulation, containing state for deposits, reserves, loans, and total money at that point.
- **Simulation Configuration**: Represents the user-defined parameters for a simulation run, including initial deposit, reserve ratio, and number of cycles.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: Regarding FR--002, the simulation can run until the available loanable amount is "negligible." What threshold should be considered negligible to automatically stop the simulation? → A: Loanable amount <=$0.00
- Q: FR-010 mentions a "3D flow diagram." To ensure the implementation meets expectations, which of these best describes the desired complexity and interactivity of the 3D visualization? → A: A simple 2D animated SVG diagram, which is more accessible and performs better than 3D.
- Q: The specification mentions a "side-by-side comparison mode" (FR-009). How should the two simulations be controlled? → A: Both simulations run, pause, and step in lockstep using a single set of controls.
- Q: The spec raises a question about handling invalid inputs: "How does the system handle non-numeric or negative values entered into the input fields?" What is the desired validation behavior? → A: Combine A and B: Disable the button, apply a red border, and show an error message.

# Double Spend Problem Simulator ‼️💰

An interactive web application that demonstrates the double spend problem in fractional-reserve banking through dynamic visualizations and simulations. This educational tool helps users understand how money creation occurs in the banking system.

## 📖 Overview

The Double Spend Problem Simulator illustrates how fractional-reserve banking can lead to money creation, effectively allowing the same money to be "spent twice" through the banking system. Users can experiment with different parameters and observe the effects through various visualizations.

# Double Spend Problem Simulator‚ÄºÔ∏èüèß
This repo contains a webpage with a simple simulator showcasing the double spend problem. This problem occurs (in this example) due to fraction-reserve banking leading to money creation, but there are other cases where the double spend problem can apply.

## Features
- Dynamically set the initial deposit amount
- Dynamically set the number of times the cycle should occur (or until < $1)
- Dyanmically set the fractional-reserve % (default is standard 10%)
- Key metric dashboard containing starting deposit, create money, total money

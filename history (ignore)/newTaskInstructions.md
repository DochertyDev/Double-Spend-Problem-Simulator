Additional Development Instructions for Flow Diagram
1. Node & Label Separation
Increase padding between nodes and their labels so text doesn’t collide with arrows or other nodes.

Anchor labels consistently (e.g., always above or below the node, not mixed).

2. Vertical Offsetting for Clarity
Cycle staggering: Every other cycle can be nudged vertically (like a zig-zag) to prevent arrow overlap.

3. Arrow Path Improvements
Replace straight arrows with curved connectors:

Deposits → Reserves: curve upward.

Loans → Spend: curve downward.

Ensure arrows have consistent curvature so the flow looks intentional, not tangled.

4. Cycle Grouping
Wrap each cycle in a visual container (e.g., a rounded rectangle or faint background box).

Add cycle numbers (Cycle 1, Cycle 2, etc.) above each group for orientation.

This makes it easier to distinguish where one cycle ends and the next begins.

5. Scaling & Responsiveness
Dynamic scaling: If too many cycles are rendered, reduce node size proportionally.

Zoom controls: Allow pinch-to-zoom or +/- buttons for users who want to see the entire chain at once.

6. Legend & Totals
Add a running total tracker (e.g., “Total Money Created: $X”) at the bottom, updating as cycles progress.

7. Implementation Steps
Add cycle containers with consistent spacing.

Refactor arrow rendering to use curved paths.

Apply vertical offsets for alternating cycles.

Add cycle numbering above each group.

Add zoom/collapse options for long chains.

✅ Outcome: A clean, scrollable timeline where each cycle is visually distinct, arrows don’t overlap, and labels remain readable even with many cycles.
